My friend [Gabe](https://github.com/gabebw) wrote a [blog post](http://gabebw.com/blog/2015/10/24/how-to-learn-a-new-programming-language) about learning a new programming language. The project creates (bad) puns by replacing words in phrases with a word that rhymes e.x. `off to a good start` becomes `off to a good heart`. This is an elm implimentation of that.

To run:

* Clone the repo
* Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
* Build the HTML: `yarn elm make src/Main.elm`. This creates `index.html`
* Get the `index.html` on a server somewhere, or start a local server
* Visit the page and enter a word like `fun` or `yes` or `heart`.

## Thanks

Thanks @gabebw for writing the [post](http://gabebw.com/blog/2015/10/24/how-to-learn-a-new-programming-language) and laying out all of the steps needed to complete the project. _Huge_ thanks to @thestrabusiness, @JoelQ, @joshuaclayton, and @gnfisher for reviewing and pairing on the code.
